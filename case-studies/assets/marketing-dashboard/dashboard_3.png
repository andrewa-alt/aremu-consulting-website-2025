Marketing Performance Dashboard
Executive Summary This is a premium, real-time business intelligence dashboard designed to give marketing teams and executives an instant pulse check on campaign performance. It acts as a stunning visual layer on top of your raw data, transforming complex spreadsheets into a sleek, "dark mode" interface that highlights the metrics that matter most—hires, spend, profitability, and operational efficiency.

1. Live Connectivity & Architecture
The application uses a Serverless On-Demand Architecture to ensure data is always fresh.

The Brain (Google Sheets): Your Google Sheet remains the single source of truth where raw data is aggregated.
The Bridge (Python on Vercel): When you load the app, a Python serverless function (/api/data) triggers instantly. It securely authenticates with Google APIs, reads specific cell ranges (mapped to your exact business KPIs), and normalizes the data on the fly.
The Visuals (React Frontend): The robust React application consumes this structured data and renders it into the UI you see.
Performance: The system uses intelligent caching (stale-while-revalidate), meaning the dashboard loads instantly for users while silently fetching the absolute latest numbers in the background.

2. User Experience & Key Features
Dashboard Hero: The "Pulse"
The top section is a dedicated Live Daily Performance monitor. It immediately answers "How are we doing today?" without needing to scroll.

Core Metrics: Visualizes Daily Spend, Cost Per Hire (CPH), and Drop Rate (Live).
Traffic Signals: Uses color-coded text (Emerald Green vs. Rose Red) to instantly flag performance against thresholds (e.g., if Hires % drops below target, it turns red).
Visual Efficiency: Metrics are large, legible, and high-contrast against a glassmorphic dark background.
Campaign Hub: Vertical-Specific Cards
Below the hero, the dashboard segments data into specific campaign cards. Each card is custom-built for that business vertical's unique KPIs:

Personal Injury (WA PI & NSW PI):
Focuses heavily on volume and conversion flow: Gross Enquiries → Submitted → Signed.
Comparison Views: Automatically compares "Yesterday" vs. "Month-to-Date (MTD)" performance side-by-side.
Smart Formatting: As per your latest update, these figures are strictly whole numbers (no decimals) for rapid scanning.
Claims 360:
Financial focus: Highlights Income, Profit, and Non-Fault (NF) metrics.
Visual Distinction: This card now features a brighter, distinct background opacity and a full-color logo to signify its importance distinct from the legal campaigns.
Inbound / Instant Marketing:
Conversion focus: Tracks Hires, Opportunities, and Predicted Instructions.
Includes a "Monthly Spend" tracker to keep budget adherence in view.
Crash Claim:
Operational data: Tracks Validation % and Booking %, ensuring the operations team knows not just volume but quality.
Detailed Drill-Downs
Clicking any card opens a Campaign Detail View. This removes the noise and focuses on deep-dive tables and historical trends for that specific campaign, allowing managers to investigate why a number is up or down.

3. Design & Polish
The app is built to feel like premium software, not a basic internal tool:

Aesthetics: Deep zinc branding zinc-950, blurred glass overlays, and subtle glowing gradients.
Branding: Custom logos for every campaign are integrated into the background of cards, providing immediate visual clicking recognition.
Responsiveness: Works seamlessly on desktop monitors or executive tablets/phones
