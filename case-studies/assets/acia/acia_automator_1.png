Accident Claims Intelligent Automator (ACIA)

The Accident Claims Intelligent Automator is a 24/7 digital triage and growth engine designed for insurance brokers and claims management firms. It transforms raw accident data into actionable revenue opportunities by combining expert-level liability analysis with empathetic, instant communication.

🚀 Key Benefits
1. Win the Race to the Claimant
In claims management, the "Golden Hour" is the window of time after an accident before a claimant speaks to a competing insurer. This system processes reports in seconds, not hours.

The Benefit: By delivering an instant, professional response, you secure the "First Notice of Loss" (FNOL) and prevent high-value claims from leaking to competitors.

2. Expert Liability Triage (Without the Salary)
The system acts as a virtual claims adjuster, reading through complex accident descriptions to determine who is truly at fault based on your specific legal criteria.

The Benefit: It filters out "no-win" cases and highlights high-probability recovery opportunities automatically, ensuring your team only spends time on the most profitable files.

3. Hyper-Personalized "Pitch" Logic
Standard auto-responders feel cold and are often ignored. This system uses AI to write custom emails tailored to the specific situation of the recipient.

The Non-Fault Client: Receives a reassuring message about protecting their No Claims Discount and getting a free replacement car.

The Third Party: Receives an empathetic offer for help, turning a potential "other side" into a new revenue stream.

The At-Fault Client: Is reminded of their "Choice of Repairer" rights, keeping the vehicle in your network rather than the insurer’s.

4. Zero-Touch Data Management
Manual data entry is the enemy of scale. This system automatically syncs every detail—from registration numbers to accident notes—directly into Zoho CRM.

The Benefit: Your staff opens their dashboard to find fully-formed leads ready for action. No typing, no typos, and no missed details.

5. Protects Your Repair Volume
Insurance companies often try to steer even at-fault drivers toward their own "approved" repairers. This system identifies clients who have "Choice of Repairer" in their policy.

The Benefit: It proactively educates the client on their rights, ensuring your workshops stay busy regardless of who caused the accident.
