LedgerLens: The AI Accounting Gateway
LedgerLens is an intelligent automation system that transforms the chaotic influx of financial documents into structured, audit-ready data. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) and computer vision logic, it monitors your accounts in real-time to capture every expense the moment it occurs—no manual data entry required.

🚀 Key Capabilities
1. Zero-Touch Expense Capture
The system acts as a 24/7 digital clerk for your invoices@ or receipts@ inbox. It autonomously detects new emails, identifies whether the data is in the email body or an attachment, and begins processing immediately.

The Benefit: Eliminates the "end-of-month" box of receipts. Your bookkeeping stays current to the minute.

2. Multi-Channel AI Extraction
Whether an invoice arrives as a professional PDF, a messy image of a thermal receipt, or just text in the body of an email, LedgerLens uses OpenRouter AI to "read" the document like a human accountant would.

Structured Data: It extracts Date, Vendor, Amount, Currency, and Expense Category (e.g., Travel, Utility, Subscription) with pinpoint accuracy.

3. Automatic Document Digitalization
Not every receipt comes as a file. If an invoice is sent as a formatted email (like an Uber or Amazon receipt), the system automatically converts the HTML into a clean, professional PDF.

The Benefit: Every single transaction—even those without original attachments—is archived as a standardized PDF in your permanent records.

4. Intelligent Naming & Filing
Forget files named IMG_592.jpg. The system renames every document using a "kebab-case" logic (e.g., 2024-05-12-adobe-subscription-14-99.pdf) and uploads it directly to a secure Google Drive folder.

The Benefit: Instant searchability. You or your accountant can find any document in seconds by searching for the date, vendor, or amount.

5. Live Ledger Sync
Once the data is extracted and the file is saved, the system appends a new row to your Google Sheets Master Ledger, including a direct clickable link to the archived file.

The Benefit: Your spreadsheet becomes a live financial dashboard. You have a "paper trail" that is fully linked and ready for tax season.
